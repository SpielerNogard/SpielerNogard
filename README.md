hi, I am Christopher MÃ¼ller, a developer from Oldenburg (Germany). Currently 22 years old. I've been programming since I was a kid, pretty much anything that comes to my mind. In my spare time I'm a mapper for Pokemon Go maps, I like to deal with hardware and how things are built, but spend even more time solving complex problems. My main areas are web programming (HTML, PHP, JS, Python), cloud development (AWS CI/CD), databases (Mysql, DynamoDB, Timestream, MongoDB), Docker, Linux and so on are of course also part of the repertoire. 
Favorite programming language is currently Python.

I would love to try Go, and am actually always looking for new exciting projects to spend my time on.
